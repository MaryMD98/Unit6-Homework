# Coding Quiz Challenge

## Description of the homework:

In this homework, I created a coding Quiz using homeworks and miniprojects from the Bootcamp activities that I have done so far.

After responding each question, a new question is dsplayed. Once all questions are answered, a new screen loads to display the total score and a textbox to enter the users Initial. when submited. a new page display to show the highest score.
This page has two buttoms, one to start the game and the other to reset the scores and start the gme again.
